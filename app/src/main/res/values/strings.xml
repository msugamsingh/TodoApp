    <string name="supportMe">The 4TR Productivity App is not just about timer or to-do, it\'s way more than that. I\'m
        working really hard for this app, I assure every single user out there that more features and improvements will be there, But that won\'t happen
        if you don\'t help me. \nPlease support me by sharing this app and rating this app 5 star on the Playstore.
